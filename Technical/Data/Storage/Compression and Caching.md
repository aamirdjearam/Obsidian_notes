Compression:
- Reduce the amount of data stored
- Faster Query (less to search)
- Faster Transport (less to move)

Caching:
- Some storages are faster to access
- Memory is 1000x faster than SSDs and CPU caches are orders of magnitude faster than memory
- Faster storage is more limited and expensive
